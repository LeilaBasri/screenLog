<h1>The onmousemove event occurs every time the mouse pointer is moved over an div element.</h1>
Mouse over the rectangle and get the coordinates of your mouse pointer.
When the mouse is moved over the div, the p element will display the horizontal and vertical coordinates of your mouse pointer, whose values are returned from the clientX and clientY properties on the MouseEvent object.
